## Intro and Things to Note
These notes were written by me, Kye Shimizu, during my Policy Management BSc at Keio University @SFC. I am publishing them here to help my classmates and other students in the years below me. 
To the best of my knowledge they are correct, however please note the following:

*These notes are not endorsed by Keio University, the module lecturers, or any member of College staff.

*These notes are not checked by any qualified individual, and I offer no guarantee as to how accurate or complete these notes are. They are offered for free, as-is, and I accept no responsibility for how you choose to use them.

*These notes were relevant for my year, but the content for your course may have changed. Check your lecture slides, syllabi, tutorial guides, etc.

*These notes were produced for personal use (it's how I like to revise) and sharing them was an afterthough. That means that the handwriting is scruffy, some annotations may by irrelevant, and some topics might be skipped entirely.
There are no notes for management modules, robotics, etc. Sorry!
